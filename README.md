# data-intrusion
Cybersecurity project tackling identifying features to predict attempted intrusions.

## Overview
- Problem Definition:
    - The goal of our project is to create a honey-pot in order to collect data and then analyze it to identify the origins and timing of attempted cyber intrusions. By understanding and identifying the key features of intrusion attempts, we aim to enhance our ability to detect and mitigate potential threats to our data infrastructure. The data collected is essential for this as it provides insights into the methods, sources, and timing of these intrusion attempts, enabling us to inform effective countermeasures.

- Value:
    - Solving this problem of data intrusions is significant for protecting organizational data. By identifying and analyzing patterns in intrusion attempts, we can proactively enhance our cybersecurity measures, thereby reducing the risk of costly ransom demands from cyber attacks. Moreover, improving the protection of our data infrastructure ensures the security and privacy of sensitive information collected by our organization. This becomes increasingly crucial for growing organizations, as they expand their reach and accumulate larger volumes of data, making them more vulnerable to cyber threats. Additionally, our analysis will have a global scope, allowing us to identify common patterns in intrusions, thereby contributing to broader cybersecurity efforts and enhancing the resilience of organizations worldwide.
